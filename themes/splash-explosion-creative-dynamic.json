    "prompt": "The Product Photography with motion-freeze in mid-air captured style. The style captures a dramatic mid-air motion-freeze moment where dynamic elements related to the uploaded product explode from behind the product, scattering outward in a seamless radial pattern that creates an energetic, high-impact visual experience with perfect motion blur control and crystalline clarity. The upper left quadrant features a deep midnight blue background that creates dramatic contrast, with product elements beginning their explosive journey from behind the product's left side. These product-derived elements catch the key lighting, creating brilliant sparkles that appear suspended in mid-air. The lighting here is precise and directional, highlighting each element's texture while maintaining the frozen moment effect. The upper right quadrant continues the explosion pattern with translucent product elements frozen mid-trajectory, their forms perfectly preserved as they arc outward from the product's right side. The background transitions to a deep indigo, creating depth while maintaining the dramatic lighting that illuminates each element from within, suggesting internal light sources. The middle left quadrant shows the product itself, positioned as the epicenter of the explosion with dynamic product elements emerging from behind it. Vapor trails and product particles flow seamlessly from the product's contours, creating organic transitions between the product surface and the scattered elements. The lighting emphasizes the product's features while making the explosion appear to originate from within the product itself. The middle right quadrant displays the explosion at its peak radius, with energy rings and ripple effects in perfect circular patterns around the product. The scattered elements here include various forms derived from the product's material and nature, creating a halo effect that appears to emanate from the product's core. The seamless blending between product and explosion elements creates the illusion that the product is generating the explosive display. The bottom left quadrant captures the explosion's ground-level effects, with scattered product remnants forming geometric patterns and splash structures creating intricate product formations. The lighting here creates subtle reflections that suggest the explosion continues below the visible frame, while shadows from the explosion elements add depth and dimension to the composition. The bottom right quadrant completes the explosion scene with the outermost elements of the blast pattern, where fine product mist and particles create a delicate fringe effect. The floor shows subtle impact craters and residue that suggest the explosion's full force, while the lighting creates a soft glow that emanates from the scattered elements, unifying the entire composition. The overall atmosphere is dynamic and electrifying, capturing a perfect mid-air moment of explosive energy that seamlessly integrates the product with the surrounding dynamic elements that are creatively interpreted based on the uploaded product's characteristics."
