    "prompt": "The Product Photography with studio setting. This unified studio space is characterized by a high-contrast, vibrant, and minimalist studio aesthetic built on a striking complementary color scheme of saturated yellows and clean whites, using geometric staging and bright, diffused lighting.In the upper area of the studio a field of pure, intense saffron yellow, flat and without a discernible gradient, creating a massive area of positive color. This bright hue continues across the top right, filling the entire upper half with a uniform, luminous yellow backdrop. The lighting here is soft and even, with no harsh shadows cast on the backdrop itself, suggesting a large, diffused light source. Moving to the middle left, the scene is anchored by a sharp, cubic white pedestal. The lighting is precise, creating a small, subtle shadow directly beneath the cube, indicating a light source angled from the front-right. The texture of the white cube is matte and smooth. This is contrasted by the raw, earthy texture of the ginger roots resting on it. The flow continues to the middle right, where the vibrant yellow background persists, meeting another, slightly smaller white cube. The composition uses clean, geometric lines established by the white blocks against the soft, organic curves of the surrounding elements. Finally, the bottom left shows the seamless transition of the yellow background into the floor plane, where the color darkens marginally into a warm mustard tone due to ambient occlusion. A low, soft shadow is cast from the front elements across the floor. Transitioning to the bottom right, the minimal staging continues, with the elements grounded on the floor by a crisp, clean white square base, strategically centered. The overall atmosphere is clean, energetic, and graphic, utilizing saturated color fields and sharp, well-defined forms for a powerful visual impact."
