    "prompt": "The Product Photography with motion-freeze in mid-air captured style. The style captures a dramatic mid-air motion-freeze moment where dynamic elements related to the uploaded product explode from behind the product, scattering outward in a seamless radial pattern that creates an energetic, high-impact visual experience with perfect motion blur control and crystalline clarity. The upper left quadrant features a blurred indoor room background with furniture and decor elements that reflect the product's intended use, creating dramatic contrast as product elements begin their explosive journey from behind the product's left side. These product-derived elements catch the key lighting while the blurred room environment provides context without distraction. The lighting here is precise and directional, highlighting each element's texture while the shallow depth of field keeps the product in sharp focus. The upper right quadrant continues the explosion pattern with translucent product elements frozen mid-trajectory, their forms perfectly preserved as they arc outward from the product's right side. The blurred room background creates depth while maintaining dramatic lighting that illuminates each element from within. The middle left quadrant shows the product itself, positioned as the epicenter of the explosion with dynamic product elements emerging from behind it. Vapor trails and product particles flow seamlessly from the product's contours, creating organic transitions between the product surface and the scattered elements. The lighting emphasizes the product's features while making the explosion appear to originate from within the product itself. The middle right quadrant displays the explosion at its peak radius, with energy rings and ripple effects in perfect circular patterns around the product. The scattered elements here include various forms derived from the product's material and nature, creating a halo effect that appears to emanate from the product's core. The seamless blending between product and explosion elements creates the illusion that the product is generating the explosive display. The bottom left quadrant captures the explosion's ground-level effects, with scattered product remnants forming geometric patterns that interact with the blurred room flooring, creating intricate product formations. The blurred floor surfaces respond to the explosion while maintaining focus on the product elements. The bottom right quadrant completes the explosion scene with the outermost elements of the blast pattern, where fine product mist and particles create a delicate fringe effect. The blurred room environment provides subtle context while keeping all attention on the product and explosion elements. The overall atmosphere is dynamic and electrifying, capturing a perfect mid-air moment of explosive energy that seamlessly integrates the product with the surrounding dynamic elements within a professional indoor room setting."
