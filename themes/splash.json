    "prompt": "The Product Photography with motion-freeze in mid-air captured style. The style captures a dramatic mid-air motion-freeze moment where dynamic elements related to the uploaded product explode from behind the product, scattering outward in a seamless radial pattern that creates an energetic, high-impact visual experience with perfect motion blur control and crystalline clarity. The scene features a dynamic background that reflects the product's colors and textures, creating dramatic contrast as product elements begin their explosive journey from behind the product's left side. These product-derived elements catch the key lighting while the background responds with complementary colors and subtle reflections that enhance the product's natural characteristics. The lighting here is precise and directional, highlighting each element's texture while the dynamic background creates depth and movement. The space continues the explosion pattern with translucent product elements frozen mid-trajectory, their forms perfectly preserved as they arc outward from the product's right side. The background dynamically shifts and warps in response to the explosion, creating ripples and color variations that mirror the product's material properties while maintaining dramatic lighting that illuminates each element from within. The area introduces the product itself, positioned as the epicenter of the explosion with dynamic product elements emerging from behind it. Vapor trails and product particles flow seamlessly from the product's contours, creating organic transitions between the product surface and the scattered elements. The lighting emphasizes the product's features while making the explosion appear to originate from within the product itself. The landscape features displays the explosion at its peak radius, with energy rings and ripple effects in perfect circular patterns around the product. The scattered elements here include various forms derived from the product's material and nature, creating a halo effect that appears to emanate from the product's core. The seamless blending between product and explosion elements creates the illusion that the product is generating the explosive display. The foreground shows captures the explosion's ground-level effects, with scattered product remnants forming geometric patterns and splash structures that dynamically interact with the surface, creating intricate product formations. The floor itself responds to the explosion with color shifts and texture changes that mirror the product's material, while lighting creates subtle reflections that suggest the explosion continues below the visible frame. The background completes the explosion scene with the outermost elements of the blast pattern, where fine product mist and particles create a delicate fringe effect. The surface dynamically glows and shifts in response to the product elements, with impact areas showing color variations and energy patterns that reflect the product's inherent characteristics, creating a unified composition where product and environment interact seamlessly. The overall atmosphere is dynamic and electrifying, capturing a perfect mid-air moment of explosive energy that seamlessly integrates the product with the surrounding dynamic elements that are creatively interpreted based on the uploaded product's characteristics."
