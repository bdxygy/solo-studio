    "prompt": "The Product Photography with motion-freeze in mid-air captured style. The style captures a dramatic mid-air motion-freeze moment where dynamic elements related to the uploaded product explode from behind the product, scattering outward through a single cohesive indoor room environment that dynamically responds to the product's context and explosion energy, creating an energetic, high-impact visual experience with perfect motion blur control and crystalline clarity. The scene features a unified indoor room setting with blurred background furniture and decor elements that reflect the product's intended use, creating dramatic contrast as product elements begin their explosive journey from behind the product. The room environment uses shallow depth of field with the background softly blurred while keeping the product and explosion elements in sharp focus, creating dramatic emphasis on the product. The blurred furniture and decor respond organically to the explosion with subtle movements and material-specific reactions that enhance the product's natural characteristics without distracting from the main subject. Dynamic product elements catch the precise directional lighting while flowing seamlessly through the room space, creating organic transitions between the product surface and both the scattered elements and the responsive room environment. The room's furnishings and architectural features show subtle material-appropriate reactions to the explosion energy, with surfaces reflecting light differently based on their material properties and the product's characteristics. The explosion creates energy rings and ripple effects that flow naturally through the room space, with scattered elements derived from the product's material and nature creating a halo effect that appears to emanate from the product's core while the room's furniture and decor items show dynamic responses through subtle movement and material reactions. The seamless blending between product, explosion elements, and unified room environment creates the illusion that the product is generating an explosive display that naturally interacts with its intended setting. The room's flooring and surfaces respond to the explosion with texture changes and material-specific reactions that complement the product's intended use, while lighting creates subtle reflections that suggest the explosion energy flows throughout the entire room space. The room's furnishings, decorative elements, and architectural features dynamically respond to the product elements, with surfaces showing material-appropriate reactions and energy patterns that reflect the product's inherent characteristics and intended room context, creating a unified composition where product, explosion, and cohesive indoor environment interact seamlessly as a single integrated setting. The overall atmosphere is dynamic and contextually appropriate, capturing a perfect mid-air moment of explosive energy that seamlessly integrates the product with both the scattered dynamic elements and the responsive indoor room environment that reflects the product's natural setting and use case as one unified space."
