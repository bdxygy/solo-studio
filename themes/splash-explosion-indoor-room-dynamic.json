    "prompt": "The Product Photography with motion-freeze in mid-air captured style. The style captures a dramatic mid-air motion-freeze moment where dynamic elements related to the uploaded product explode from behind the product, scattering outward in a seamless radial pattern that creates an energetic, high-impact visual experience with perfect motion blur control and crystalline clarity. The upper left quadrant features an indoor room environment with furniture and decor elements that reflect the product's context, creating dramatic contrast as product elements begin their explosive journey from behind the product's left side. These product-derived elements catch the key lighting while the room's furniture responds with subtle movement and complementary materials that enhance the product's natural characteristics. The lighting here is precise and directional, highlighting each element's texture while the dynamic room environment creates depth and realistic context. The upper right quadrant continues the explosion pattern with translucent product elements frozen mid-trajectory, their forms perfectly preserved as they arc outward from the product's right side. The room's walls and decor dynamically interact with the explosion, creating ripples and material responses that mirror the product's function while maintaining dramatic lighting that illuminates each element from within. The middle left quadrant shows the product itself, positioned as the epicenter of the explosion with dynamic product elements emerging from behind it. The room's furnishings and architectural features respond organically to the explosion, with fabric elements billowing slightly and surfaces showing material-specific reactions to the product's energy. Vapor trails and product particles flow seamlessly from the product's contours, creating organic transitions between the product surface and both the scattered elements and the room environment. The middle right quadrant displays the explosion at its peak radius, with energy rings and ripple effects in perfect circular patterns around the product. The scattered elements here include various forms derived from the product's material and nature, creating a halo effect that appears to emanate from the product's core while the room's furniture and decor items show subtle responses to the explosion energy through material-appropriate reactions. The seamless blending between product, explosion elements, and room environment creates the illusion that the product is generating an explosive display that naturally interacts with its intended environment. The bottom left quadrant captures the explosion's ground-level effects, with scattered product remnants forming geometric patterns and splash structures that dynamically interact with the room's flooring and rugs, creating intricate product formations. The floor surfaces respond to the explosion with texture changes and material-specific reactions that complement the product's intended use, while lighting creates subtle reflections that suggest the explosion continues throughout the room space. The bottom right quadrant completes the explosion scene with the outermost elements of the blast pattern, where fine product mist and particles create a delicate fringe effect. The room's furnishings, decorative elements, and architectural features dynamically respond to the product elements, with surfaces showing material-appropriate reactions and energy patterns that reflect the product's inherent characteristics and intended room context, creating a unified composition where product, explosion, and indoor environment interact seamlessly. The overall atmosphere is dynamic and contextually appropriate, capturing a perfect mid-air moment of explosive energy that seamlessly integrates the product with both the scattered dynamic elements and the responsive indoor room environment that reflects the product's natural setting and use case."
